In Jenkins
=============
we can install or configure the build tools in 2 ways
1. within the jenkins settings-->global tools configutaion section
here in this section we will see the out of the box tools listed by jenkins such as 
"maven, any, gradel, jdk"
So, we want to setup anyof the available outofthebox tools we can select the tool and configure instantly by choosing the version# we wanted on our project

2. If our build tool are not listed here outofthebox, we need to download in the plugins sections
For ewxample., if we want docker or (npm/yard . need to install nodejs plugin first)
Then configure the build tools based on out needs on the global tools configutaion section


In Jenkinsfile
=================


Pipeline{

    agent any{
        stages{
            stage("JSfrontend"){
                steps{
                    echo "its the build stage" 
                    
                    nodejs('Node-10.17'){
                          sh 'yarn install'
                          sh 'yarn -v'
                    }                   
                }                
            }
            stage("javabackgrolund"){
                steps{
                    echo "its the test stage"
                    withGradel(){
                        sh './gradlew -v'
                    }

                }
            }
          
        }
    }
}


WE CAN ALSO USE THE SAME BUILD TOOLS WITHOUT THE WRAPPER COMMANDS MENTIONED ABOVE BY USING THE ATTRIBUTE CALLED "TOOLS"
AS ONLY NOW, THE "TOOLS" ATTRIBUTE ON THE JENKINSFILES SUPPOTS ONLY JDK,MAVEN,AND gradle

Pipeline{

    agent any

    tools{
        gradle 'Gradle-6.2'
    }

        stages{
            stage("JSfrontend"){
                steps{
                    echo "its the build stage" 
                    
                    nodejs('Node-10.17'){
                          sh 'yarn install'
                          sh 'yarn -v'
                    }                   
                }                
            }
            stage("javabackgrolund"){
                steps{
                    echo "its the test stage"
                    sh './gradlew -v'
                    
                }
            }
          
        }
    
}
