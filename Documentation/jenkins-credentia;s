jenkins credentials
====================

1. credentials is one of the most popular plugins which are added recently as part of the jenkins package
2. credentials are the module within the jenkins which stores the username,pass, secret key, sectret file, SSH etc.,

There are 2 types of credentials available 

1. system scope - its used only by the jenkins server are not used by any any jobs within the jenkins
2. global scope -  its the credentials which is basically used on the jenkins jobs

With in the individual "multibranch pipeline" jenkins project ONLY, we will have the 3rd scope,

3. project scope - credentials scoped to the project (we can have all our tools credential;s here such as GIT., etc)
