Declarative Pipeline
Declarative Pipeline is a relatively recent addition to Jenkins Pipeline [1] which presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems.

All valid Declarative Pipelines must be enclosed within a pipeline block, for example:

pipeline {
    /* insert Declarative Pipeline here */
}


The top-level of the Pipeline must be a block, specifically: pipeline { }.

No semicolons as statement separators. Each statement has to be on its own line.

Blocks must only consist of Sections, Directives, Steps, or assignment statements.

A property reference statement is treated as a no-argument method invocation. So, for example, input is treated as input().

You can use the Declarative Directive Generator to help you get started with configuring the directives and sections in your Declarative Pipeline.
