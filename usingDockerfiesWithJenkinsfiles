Using a Dockerfile
===================
For projects which require a more customized execution environment, Pipeline also supports 
building and running a container from a Dockerfile in the source repository. In contrast to 
the previous approach of using an "off-the-shelf" container, using the agent { dockerfile 
true } syntax will build a new image from a Dockerfile rather than pulling one from Docker Hub.

Re-using an example from above, with a more custom Dockerfile:
*****************************************************
Dockerfile
FROM node:7-alpine

RUN apk add -U subversion
By committing this to the root of the source repository, the Jenkinsfile can be changed to build a container based on this Dockerfile and then run the defined steps using that container:
*********************************************************
Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)
pipeline {
    agent { dockerfile true }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
                sh 'svn --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
The agent { dockerfile true } syntax supports a number of other options which are described in more detail in the Pipeline Syntax section.
